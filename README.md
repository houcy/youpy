Youpy
------

# Introduction
Youpy aims at smoothing Python learning curve for beginners with
knowledge of Scratch. We do this by providing an execution framework
and a front-end API as close to Scratch as possible.

# Philosophy
## Goals

- Make beginners enjoy programming in Python as much as in Scratch
- Enable graphical interface and not only input/print.
- Easy and straight forward with the less implicit magic possible
- Write plain Python code

## Non-goals

- No 3D: 2D is enough for beginners
- Fast rendering: we only need to handle a handful of a hundreds
  sprite at most

# Implementation status

This project is still under development. You can have a look and the
implementation status of [Scratch function](SCRATCH.md).
